**This is currently Version 1.0.**  
✅ Initial release complete.  
🚀 Future updates are planned to add new features and optimize performance.  
Stay tuned for changelogs!

This repository provides C++ deployment code for biped robot motion control, 
leveraging ONNX Runtime for high-performance model inference in real-world robotics systems. 
It enables seamless deployment of pre-trained reinforcement learning policies (exported 
as ONNX models from *.pt or *.pth models) onto Linux-based edge devices or robot hardware, 
ensuring low-latency, real-time control for robots like Unitree Q1. The codebase includes 
optimized inference pipelines, hardware acceleration support (CPU/GPU), and Linux compatibility
for robotics applications.

## Full steps of operating q1_sdk on the real Q1 robot
#### Before start
```bash
cmake -DPLATFORM=arm64 .. && make && cd bin
```
#### Step 1: Check the start-up posture of the robot
#### Step 2: Boot up both the joy stick and the robot
#### Step 3: Run the executable file 
```bash
$ ./run_interface
or sudo ./run_interface
```
#### Step 4: Check the initial state of the robot
#### Step 5: Enter 1 and press enter into ready mode.
#### Step 6: Enter 2 and press enter into position stand mode.
#### Step 7: Enter 3 and press enter into AI stand control mode. Now enjoy your robot!
